// function to grid the screen in nine sections by randomizing 1-9, then attributing those to floated divs that are positioned in a 3x3 grid.
// function to randomize the size of the drops, 1-10. If it's between 1-3, change the class of the drop to tiny, 4-6 small, 7-9, medium, 10 is large, if it is 11, then it's huge and triggers a sound.
// function to randomize the intensity of the raindrop frequency and size this will chnage a setInterval value in milliseconds, between drops.
// function to randomize the amount of divisions that are being rained upon 1-9, based on intensity from previous function.
// function to diminish the size of the drops based on intensity.
// function to increase the size of the dros based on intensity.
// function to randomize wind direction , call once per a setInterval.
// function to setInterval between large gusty bombardments. based on wind direction, trigger wind sound, trigger raindrop swath.
// function to randomize wind sound
// function to determine shape of swath, larger drops in the center smaller on the outside, more frequent in the center, less on the outside.
// function to increase frequency and intensity based on gusty swath.
// function to populate raindrop swaths based on wind direction
// function to randomize lightning location
// function to specify randomized(1-12) lightning color range. blue range is 1-7, 8-10 is purple range, 11-12 is yellow range.
// function to randomize color values within the blue, purple and yellow spectrum. use a variable that is set by the above function.
